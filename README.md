Received a template from friend to practice on. I think from she said its from pixilary? Either way thank you whoever you are for the template! mostly adding and deleting things. 

Still figuring out how to connect form to email using an API safely. As well as needing to add in projects that I work on.
For now i have them commented out and the outline to adding a project in listed but not filled out. added pages and changed images/background.
Version 2 will be done during the course of my training!

You're doing great! Just one step at a time! tinker with it first :)
